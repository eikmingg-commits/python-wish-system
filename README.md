A simple text-based Python program that lets the player choose a desire and see how an unknown entity grants it.
This project was created as part of my early experimentation with programming, game loops, and conditional logic.

When you run the program, you are presented with a list of desires:

1. Wealth
2. Influence
3. Wisdom
4. Immortality
5. Women

You type the number corresponding to your choice, and the program prints the result.
Choosing an invalid option triggers a hidden “ultimate wish” branch.

Future Ideas:
Add more desires and outcomes
include random surprises or events
Expand into a mini RPG-like wish system
